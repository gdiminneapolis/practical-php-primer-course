## What you'll learn

A gentle introduction to the PHP programming language.

This class will provide a brief introduction to the use of PHP, the widely-used
language that powers some of the most popular web sites today. For example,
WordPress is said to be in use on 26% of web sites [citation needed] and is
written in PHP. Along with PHP, we'll be looking at MySQL, a relational database
management system, which is used to store the information between calls to your
web application.

## Lunch / Meals

*We try to find companies to sponsor a meal during our classes if they are over 4 hours long. If we are able to find a sponsor, the meals are usually something affordable for feeding a large group, like pizza. In these instances, we will offer both vegetarian and meat based options. If you have other dietary restrictions such as gluten free, dairy free, vegan, etc., please be sure to bring your own lunch. We will notify attendees a day or two before the class on whether a meal will be provided.*
