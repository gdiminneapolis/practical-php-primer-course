## A practical primer to php programming

A gentle introduction to the PHP programming language.

This class will provide a brief introduction to the use of PHP, the widely-used
language that powers some of the most popular web sites today. For example,
WordPress is said to be in use on 26% of web sites [citation needed] and is
written in PHP. Along with PHP, we'll be looking at MySQL, a relational database
management system, which is used to store the information between calls to your
web application.
