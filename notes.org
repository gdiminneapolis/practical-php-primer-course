* Ideas for teaching

  - be problem-solution focused, not syntax-based
  - use diagrams, not words
  - start with a problem, have them work out a solution, then discuss
    and provide references
  - the slides are *not* the reference, they are only a guide
  - provide details in printed material

* Concerns

  - as ever, Windows users are sort of out in the cold (despite WAMP)
    - also lack of a common teaching / learning / developing environment
    - not the same as how they'll be deploying their work! (On a
      GNU/Linux server with Apache in all likelyhood)
  - getting users up to working PHP code as fast as possible
  - dealing with the installation and configuration of software
  - too much emphasis on basic syntax, not enough on problem solving
    and learning how to use PHP/MYSQL

* Approach

  - Start *everyone* on Cloud9 development platform in the sky
    - requires a *very* good network connection in the facility for
      everyone to be using it
  - Easy to build up a LAMP environment -- it's a standard
    configuration prebuilt in Cloud9


* Pre-requisites

  - know HTML and CSS (no JS needed for Intro)

  - understand basic programming concepts such as variables, loops,
    branching, arrays, strings, procedures and functions.

  - a Cloud9 account set up and ready to go.

    - an account requires a credit card number to sign up, but nothing
      is charged as long as they remain on the free level of service.

    - get signed up *before* class so we don't have to deal with that
      in class. I'd really rather not have to deal with the lowest
      common denominator on this. On the other hand, maybe if we step
      through it in class all together, we all get done at the same
      time?

    - we will create a (public) php-apache module in class, but feel
      free to create one beforehand if you'd like, and play around
      with it.

  - since we'll be using Cloud9's editor to be working in class, we
    don't have to worry about different editor behaviours


* Learning Cloud9's Environment

  - C9 is pretty simple to use, and the PHP/Apache/MySQL set up is
    pretty simple to use as most everything is already set up.

  - MySQL is already installed in the environment

  - PhpMyAdmin is available

    #+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
      tamouse:~/workspace $ phpmyadmin-ctl install
      Starting installation
      Starting MySQL
       ,* Starting MySQL database server mysqld
         ...done.
      Configuring database
      Starting apache
       ,* Restarting web server apache2
         ...done.

      PHPMyAdmin Installation complete. You can log in at: https://intro-to-php-tamouse.c9users.io/phpmyadmin with the following username (and blank password):

             Username: tamouse

      tamouse:~/workspace $
    #+END_SRC

      There isn't a password associated with the account.



* Outline

** Introduction

*** Static vs. Dynamic Sites

*** Dynamic Data-driven Sites

*** Terminology

    - client
    - server
    - database


*** Where does PHP fit?

*** Where does MySQL fit?

*** Where does HTML fit?

** Problem: Contact Form

*** First try: Email

*** Second try: PHP mail

*** Third try: MySQL database

** Concepts: CRUD

*** "Back office operations"

    The database created by your application probably needs to be
    administered by someone.

    - overall state, statistics, health of system (dashboard)
    - reading data (reports)
    - cleaning up data (fixing/updating)
    - deleting old records (purging)
    - extending data types (developing new features)




* Misc Notes

** Sketch.IO sketchpad
