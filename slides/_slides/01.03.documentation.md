w3shools PHP tutorial is a good introduction to the syntax and
programming structures of PHP. You can review that at your leisure.

The PHP online documentation is really well done, giving examples and
collecting usage notes from the PHP development community. You should
really become familiar with it, especially how to look up various PHP
functions.

MySQL is a rather complex system, and it's difficult to think about
delving into the documentation since it covers so much. You should
probably try to read through the specific syntax sections, although
even those can be a slog.
{:.notes}

The [Head First PHP][headfirstphpbook]{:target="_blank"} book has
quite a lot to recommend it. It's a great intro for folks who aren't
as experienced with web development especially server-side work. This
primer takes a lot from that book in terms of the style of teaching
and the exercises.
