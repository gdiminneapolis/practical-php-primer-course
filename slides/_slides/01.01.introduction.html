  <p>This class will provide a brief introduction to the use of PHP, the widely-used
    language that powers some of the most popular web sites today. For example,
    WordPress is said to be in use on 26% of web sites
    <!-- TODO: find citation for this--> [citation needed] 
    and is
    written in PHP. Along with PHP, we'll be looking at MySQL, a relational database
    management system, which is used to store the information between calls to your
    web application.</p>
  <p>We're going to learn how a web server works, how PHP fits into that to act on user requests,
    and how information is saved and retrieved from one request to the next.</p>
