# Instructions for Windows Users

These are additional instructions for those of you who run on Windows, and the commands don't quite work.

## Creating the new slide repository on Github

While Mac users get to work with `hub`, Windows users have to do things the old-fashioned way by creating the empty repository on GitHub and setting the remote origin by hand.

GUI tools such as Github Desktop for Windows or Sourcetree can help if you are uncomfortable using the GitBash shell.

See [Create a Repo](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/) on GitHub for help with creating the remote repository.
